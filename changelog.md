# Part 5: Site Changes and 3rd Party Script

## Portfolio Imrpovement:
I chose to implement a dark mode button that flips my color variables with one another. This helps maintain
my color pallete, while achieving dark mode . . . (edit)

## 3rd Party JavaScript:

I chose to add Google Analytics to my website. I only had to install a Google Tag by adding a script at the beginning of \<head\> in index.html. I added it because I think it is a pretty powerful to gain insight how my website is doing. I intend to link my portfolio website on my resume, LinkedIn, and other places. By being able to see how my website is doing with visitors, I can see interest in me. Ultimately, it is to help brand myself with the information I am given. I am able to see users within the past 30 minutes, their general location, and a history of page views, and much more.
