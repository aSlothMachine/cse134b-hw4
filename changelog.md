# Part 5: Site Changes and 3rd Party Script

## Portfolio Improvement:
I chose to implement a dark mode button that flips my color variables with one another. This helps maintain
my color palette, while achieving dark mode. I had to use JavaScript to change CSS properties and grab elements by ID to change my button colors from blue to orange. The user could also revert back to light mode and the same process would occur. I did this in my `script.js` file. However, I could not figure out how to make it permanent on the refresh of my webpage. I will have to continue it in part 5 by utilizing local storage again. 

## 3rd Party JavaScript:

I chose to add Google Analytics to my website. I only had to install a Google Tag by adding a script at the beginning of \<head\> in `index.html`. I added it because I think it is pretty powerful to gain insight into how my website is doing. I intend to link my portfolio website on my resume, LinkedIn, and other places. By being able to see how my website is doing with visitors, I can see interest in me. Ultimately, it is to help brand myself with the information I am given. I am able to see users within the past 30 minutes, their general location, and a history of page views, and much more.
